# Fair Cake-Cutting Simulator
## Project Description

The Fair Cake-Cutting Simulator is a computational exploration of the classic fair division problem, often known as the "cake-cutting problem". This project offers an innovative approach to simulate and analyze various strategies for dividing a resource (represented as a cake) among multiple participants in a fair and envy-free manner.

The core functionality of this project revolves around simulating the process of fair division. It models scenarios where participants have different perceptions of value and aims to achieve a division that is fair from everyone's perspective,which includes the proposal of a unique syntax to represent the problem.

## Applications
This simulator serves as an excellent tool for researchers and enthusiasts in the field of game theory, economics, and computational social science. It provides a practical framework to understand and analyze how different strategies and perceptions can impact the outcome of fair division in resource allocation problems.

## Getting Started
To dive into the Fair Cake-Cutting Simulator, clone this repository and explore the Python scripts that power the simulation. The project is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily modify parameters, test different scenarios, and analyze the outcomes of various cake-cutting strategies.
